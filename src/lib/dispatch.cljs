(ns ^{:doc "Event dispatching.

  Provides a way for code to react to events. Terminology:

  * event-id: Identifies a class of events. Can be any Clojure value.

  * event-data: Parameterizes a particular event. Can be any Clojure
    value.

  * reactor: A function that is invoked in response to an event
    occurring.

  * reaction: A relationship between a set of events and a reactor.

  * event-pred: A function which takes an event ID and returns true or
    false.

  Reactors are associated with events via `react-to`. When events are
  fired with an `event-id` and optional `event-data`, any reactors whose
  `event-pred` returns true for the `event-id` are invoked."}

(defn react-to
  "Cause the specified reactor to be invoked whenever an event that
  satisfies `event-pred` is fired. reactor is a function that accepts
  two arguments: `event-id` and `event-data`.

  Returns the reaction.

  The reactor will continue to be invoked until one of two things
  happens:

   1. `delete-reaction` is called on this reaction.

   2. The reaction occurs `max-count` times. If `max-count` is not
      specified, the reaction will continue to be invoked until deleted.

  If `max-count` is specified, `delete-reaction` will be called
  automatically when the reaction has occurred the specified number of
  times."
